# TODO
    - Runner
        [X] Running in a directory without any unit tests should show a _handled_ error in ~~red~~ gray. Right now it is treated as an unhandled error.
        [X] Make setup and all other functions optionally async
        [X] When all tests ~~pass or one tests fail~~ finish, post a summary message
        [X] Add Four spaces to indent error messages
        [ ] Add a result for "stubbed" tests
        [X] Add groups for tests
            [X] Groups should indent children tests
            [X] Groups should have a title and output name
            [X] Groups should have a setup and teardown step
        [X] Add teardown for individual tests
        [ ] Add skip constructor
        [X] Allow for extending the context item
        [ ] Show the test runner summary for every time _cake_ is run, not every time a test runner finishes.
